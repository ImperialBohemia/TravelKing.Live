## 🧠 Project Vision
TravelKing.Live is not just a website; it is an **Autonomous Business Engine**. It leverages Google's enterprise AI to identify distressed travelers in real-time and provides them with immediate, legally-backed solutions for flight compensation via the AirHelp partnership.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (OMEGA)
The system is built on a modular, "Brain-first" architecture:

- **`Brain/Core/`**: The engine room. Contains the `connector.py` (Universal Bridge) and `engine.py` (Business Logic).
- **`Brain/Templates/`**: High-conversion, mobile-optimized HTML5/Tailwind templates for "Sniper" landing pages.
- **`Brain/Knowledge/`**: The collective memory storing market research, style guides, and operational blueprints.
- **`access_vault.json`**: Secured repository of all authentication tokens (Google, FB, cPanel).

## 🚀 Key Capabilities
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vertex AI Integration** | Real-time flight delay analysis and programmatic content generation. |
| **FB Ads Automation** | Direct bridge to Facebook Ads Manager for surgical targeting of delayed flights. |
| **Programmatic SEO** | Instant deployment of "Sniper Pages" for specific flight numbers (e.g., OK618). |
| **Multi-Engine Indexing** | Automated submission to both Google and Bing for 100% visibility. |
| **Immortal Connection** | Self-healing tokens and permanent page access protocols enabled. |
| **Legal Compliance** | Fully automated generation of GDPR-compliant Privacy, Terms, and Impressum pages. |

## 🛠️ Global Setup
### Permanent Bridge
The system uses a singular entry point for all operations:
```python
from Brain.Core.connector import bridge
# Bridge grants instant access to Google, Facebook, and cPanel APIs.
```

### Infrastructure
- **Main Domain**: `travelking.live`
- **Backup Domain**: `simplecode.space`
- **Hosting**: cPanel Enterprise (server707.web-hosting.com)
