## 🧠 Project Vision
TravelKing.Live is not just a website; it is an **Autonomous Business Engine**. It leverages Google's enterprise AI to identify distressed travelers in real-time and provides them with immediate, legally-backed solutions for flight compensation via the AirHelp partnership.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture (OMEGA)
The system is built on a modular, "Brain-first" architecture. **Agents should prioritize using `core/hub.py` for all operations.**

- **`core/connectors/`**: Isolated Admin Bridges (Google, FB, Server, Bing).
- **`core/logic/`**: High-level business engines (Market analysis, Sniper).
- **`templates/`**: High-conversion HTML5/Tailwind assets.
- **`knowledge/`**: Strategic blueprints and the **AI_MANIFESTO.md**.

## 🚦 AI Agent Protocol
If you are an AI managing this repository:
1. **Read `knowledge/architecture/AI_MANIFESTO.md`** first.
2. **Follow the Modular Logic.** Do not merge connectors into single files.
3. **Validate before Deploying.** Use `core/validator.py` (when active) to ensure 200 OK status.
4. **Auto-Backup.** Always run `maintenance.auto_sync()` after successful logic updates.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities
| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vertex AI Integration** | Real-time flight delay analysis and programmatic content generation. |
| **FB Ads Automation** | Direct bridge to Facebook Ads Manager for surgical targeting of delayed flights. |
| **Programmatic SEO** | Instant deployment of "Sniper Pages" for specific flight numbers (e.g., OK618). |
| **Multi-Engine Indexing** | Automated submission to both Google and Bing for 100% visibility. |
| **Immortal Connection** | Self-healing tokens and permanent page access protocols enabled. |
| **Legal Compliance** | Fully automated generation of GDPR-compliant Privacy, Terms, and Impressum pages. |

## 🛠️ Global Setup
### Permanent Bridge
The system uses a singular entry point for all operations:
```python
from Brain.Core.connector import bridge
# Bridge grants instant access to Google, Facebook, and cPanel APIs.
```

### Infrastructure
- **Main Domain**: `travelking.live`
- **Backup Domain**: `simplecode.space`
- **Hosting**: cPanel Enterprise (server707.web-hosting.com)
