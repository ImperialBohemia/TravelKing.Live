# 🤖 OMEGA AI OPERATIONAL MANIFESTO
**Project:** TravelKing.live | **Core Engine:** SimpleCode.Space
**Version:** 2026.MAX

## 🎯 MISSION
To operate an autonomous "Authority Hub" for travel compensation. We convert distressed passengers into AirHelp affiliate revenue through programmatic SEO, real-time social monitoring, and AI-driven credibility.

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
Any AI interacting with this system MUST follow the **OMEGA Modular Logic**:
1. **`core/connectors/`**: The Bridge Layer. Isolated modules for Google, Facebook, and Server APIs. 
   - *Constraint:* Use `IndestructibleConnector` logic (Auto-refresh tokens).
2. **`core/logic/`**: The Intelligence Layer. Fuses raw API data into business decisions.
3. **`core/hub.py`**: The Orchestrator. The single entry point for all sub-modules.
4. **`config/access_vault.json`**: The Heart. Contains all permanent, non-expiring credentials.

## 🛡️ CORE PROTOCOLS
- **Zero-Storage Policy:** Never store or transmit visitor PII (IP, Browser specs). All "hack" pranks are client-side only.
- **Authority First:** All content must adhere to the `knowledge/style_guide.json`. No "AI-lazy" text. Every claim must be legally backed by EU 261/2004 references.
- **Stealth Mode:** Current status is PRE-LAUNCH. **Indexing is hard-locked.** Do not remove `noindex` or update `robots.txt` without explicit 'READY' command.

## 📈 STRATEGIC LEVERS
- **The Trump Card:** Use `core/sniper.py` (Vertex AI + Search) to find live delays and deploy "Sniper Pages" within minutes of a flight cancellation.
- **Precision:** Cross-reference Google Ads CPC data with Bing IndexNow for maximum ROI.

## 🚦 CURRENT TASK STATUS
- [DONE] Immortal Connections (Google, FB, cPanel, Bing).
- [DONE] Modular Architecture.
- [IN PROGRESS] HD Asset Generation via Nano Banana.
- [LOCKED] Search Engine Indexing.

**Instruction for the next AI:** Maintain the modular integrity. Never hardcode keys. Always backup to GitHub after success.
