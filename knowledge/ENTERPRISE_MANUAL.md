# 👑 TravelKing.Live | ENTERPRISE EXECUTION MANUAL (MAX NOW)

This manual is for the owner, Stanislav Pasztorek. It defines the path from a functioning bot to a dominant global travel empire.

## 🚀 SCALING LOGIC (1 to 1000 Leads/Day)

### 1. The Proactive Strike (Sniper Mode)
The system is now capable of "Sniper Strikes". Instead of waiting for users to find the site, the system:
- Monitors global flight disruption feeds.
- Deploys a dedicated page for a specific delayed flight (e.g., `travelking.live/delay-ok618.html`).
- Pings Bing/Google Indexing APIs.
- **Goal:** Appear at the #1 spot when a passenger at the gate searches for "Flight OK618 status".

### 2. Traffic Multipliers
- **YouTube Shorts Factory:** (Integrated with SimpleCodeSpace) Create automated 15-second videos about "How to get €600 for your flight delay".
- **Facebook Ads Bridge:** Use the `FacebookConnector` to target passengers currently checked in at specific airports during major delays.

### 3. Revenue Stacking
- **Primary:** AirHelp (€600 Recovery claims).
- **Secondary:** Automated upsell of "Airport Lounge Access" and "Fast Track" via Travelpayouts for users whose flights are delayed but they still intend to fly.

## 🛠️ OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

### Daily Health Check
Run the OMEGA monitor every morning to ensure all "Money Pipes" are open:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. && python3 core/monitor.py
```

### Engaging the Autopilot
To start the autonomous lead hunter (Sniper):
```bash
python3 engines/sniper_bot.py
```

## 💎 GOLD STANDARD QUALITY
- **Zero Friction:** Never add unnecessary fields to forms.
- **Instant Value:** The `ConciergeBot` must send the email within 120 seconds of lead capture.
- **Authority First:** Maintain the elite deep-indigo and yellow aesthetic to ensure trust.
