# 🤖 OMEGA AI OPERATIONAL MANIFESTO
**Project:** TravelKing.live | **Core Engine:** OMEGA Google-Max System
**Version:** 2026.GOOGLE_MAX

## 🎯 MISSION
To operate an autonomous "Authority Hub" using the full power of the Google Cloud ecosystem. We act on verified data, deliver instant value, and scale without technical debt.

## 🏗️ SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
1. **`core/google/factory.py`**: The single source of truth for Google services.
2. **`core/google/secrets.py`**: Data sovereignty via Cloud Secret Manager.
3. **`core/utils/backoff.py`**: Bulletproof reliability.
4. **`engines/`**: Autonomous intelligence executing verified strikes.

## 🛡️ CORE PROTOCOLS
- **Official Patterns Only:** Use official SDKs and discovery services.
- **Fail-Safe Security:** Prioritize Cloud Secrets over local files.
- **Data-Driven Decisiveness:** Use GA4 signals to inform ROI decisions.
- **Strict Logic Gate:** No strike without multi-source grounding.

## 📈 STRATEGIC LEVERS
- **Secret Manager:** Unbreakable access management.
- **GA4 Grounding:** Real-world traffic signals drive the Sniper.

**Instruction for the next AI:** Adhere to the Google-Max Blueprints. Maintain exponential backoff on all API calls. Never compromise security for speed.
