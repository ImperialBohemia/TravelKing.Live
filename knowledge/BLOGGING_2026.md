# 💎 TRAVELKING: BILLBOARD PRO STANDARD (2026)

> "Data is the new celebrity. Charts are the new paparazzi."

This document defines the mandatory **Billboard Pro** style for all TravelKing content. We are not just travel bloggers; we are **Travel Industry Analysts**.

## 1. THE "EXECUTIVE BRIEFING" FORMAT
Every post must open with a specialized briefing section designed for high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) and industry insiders.

*   **The "Data Hook":** The very first sentence must contain a hard number, percentage, or dollar amount.
    *   *Bad:* "Private jets are becoming popular."
    *   *Good:* "Private aviation charter demand surged **23% YoY in Q1 2026**, driven by a 40% spike in trans-Atlantic bookings."
*   **The "3-Bullet Brief":** Immediately following the hook, provide three high-level takeaways.
    *   **The Trend:** What is happening?
    *   **The Why:** What is the root cause?
    *   **The Opportunity:** How does the reader profit/benefit?

## 2. CHART DENSITY & VISUAL ANALYTICS
Billboard Pro relies heavily on charts to prove authority. Since we generate text, we must rigorously define where visuals go.

*   **Mandatory "Chartist" Placeholders:** Every 300 words, insert a bracketed directive for a specific chart type.
    *   `[INSERT CHART: Bar Graph comparing 2025 vs 2026 Flight Costs]`
    *   `[INSERT DATA VISUAL: Pie Chart of Market Share by Airline]`
*   **The "Why It Matters" Callout:** A distinct section (or box) explicitly labeled **"Why It Matters"** that connects the data to the reader's bottom line or travel strategy.

## 3. TONE: THE INDUSTRY INSIDER
*   **Voice:** Authoritative, detached but sharp, "Inside Baseball."
*   **Vocabulary:** Use industry terms correctly (e.g., "Yield Management," "Load Factor," "Ancillary Revenue," "Deadhead Legs").
*   **No Fluff:** Avoid adjectives like "amazing," "stunning," or "beautiful." Use "high-yield," "strategic," "efficient," and "exclusive."

## 4. E-E-A-T + AIEO (RETAINED)
*   **Experience:** Retain the personal anecdote, but frame it as "Field Intelligence" rather than a diary entry.
*   **AIEO:** The structure (Briefing -> Data -> Analysis -> Action) is inherently AI-friendly.

## 5. CONTENT ANATOMY (THE BILLBOARD TEMPLATE)
1.  **Headline:** Data-Driven & Professional (e.g., "Global Business Travel Forecast: 2026 Rates to Rise 8.5%").
2.  **Executive Briefing:** The 3-Bullet Summary.
3.  **The "Data Hook" Intro:** Hard numbers immediately.
4.  **Body Section A (The Trend):** H2 Header + `[INSERT CHART]`.
5.  **"Why It Matters":** The Industry Analysis.
6.  **Body Section B (The Field Report):** "Field Intelligence" (Personal Story framed as data/observation).
7.  **Strategic Outlook:** Future predictions based on the data.
8.  **The Verdict (CTA):** "Access the Network" via Villiers.

## 6. VISUAL IDENTITY (THE BILLBOARD LOOK)
To maintain the "Pro" aesthetic, all content must align with these visual tokens (for future frontend implementation):

*   **Primary Accent:** `#00FF9A` (Neon Green) - Use for "Pro" badges, active states, and data highlights.
*   **Secondary Accent:** `#003FFA` (Royal Blue) - Use for links and primary calls to action.
*   **Typography:**
    *   **Headlines:** *Crystal Ultra Condensed Bold* (Impactful, Trade Magazine style).
    *   **Body:** *Georgia* (Serif, high readability, "Journalistic" feel).
    *   **Data/Captions:** *Azeret Mono* (Technical, analyst feel).
*   **Layout:** "Larva" Grid System - High density, card-based, sidebar-heavy (for charts).
