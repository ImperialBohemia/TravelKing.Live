# 💎 TRAVELKING: 2026 BLOGGING GOLD STANDARD

> "In the age of AI, the only differentiator is humanity."

This document defines the mandatory standards for all blog content generated or published by TravelKing in 2026. These rules are non-negotiable and designed to dominate both Traditional Search (SEO) and AI Generative Search (GSE).

## 1. THE CORE PHILOSOPHY: E-E-A-T + HUMANITY
Search engines and AI now prioritize **Experience**, **Expertise**, **Authoritativeness**, and **Trustworthiness**.
*   **Mandatory Personal Anecdote:** Every post must include a "Real World" section or anecdote (e.g., "When I was stranded in Prague...") to prove human experience.
*   **Expert Citations:** Must cite at least one external authoritative source (e.g., IATA report, Government travel warning) with a link.
*   **Unique Value:** Never just summarize. Add a "TravelKing Verdict" or "Insider Tip" that competitors miss.

## 2. AI ENGINE OPTIMIZATION (AIEO)
To be cited by Gemini, ChatGPT, and Perplexity, content must be structured for machine parsing.
*   **"Key Takeaways" Box:** Every post MUST start with a bulleted summary of 3-5 key points.
*   **Direct Answers:** The first sentence under a heading must directly answer the user's implied question.
*   **Lists & Tables:** Use bullet points and comparison tables aggressively. AI loves structured data.

## 3. VISUAL & STRUCTURAL STANDARDS
*   **Visual Density:** 7-10 visuals per post (images, infographics, charts).
    *   *Constraint:* If generating text-only, placeholders must be inserted: `[INSERT IMAGE: Description of flight map]`.
*   **Skimmability:**
    *   Paragraphs: Max 2-3 sentences.
    *   One idea per sentence.
    *   Bold key phrases for scanners.
*   **Mobile-First:** No wall of text. Frequent breaks with H2/H3 headers.

## 4. CONTENT ANATOMY (THE TEMPLATE)
1.  **Headline:** engaging, benefits-focused, under 60 chars.
2.  **Introduction:** Hook + Empathy + "Key Takeaways" Box.
3.  **Body:**
    *   H2 Headers (Keyword Rich)
    *   H3 Sub-headers for depth
    *   *The "Human" Section (Personal Story)*
    *   *Data/Expertise Section (Stats/Citations)*
4.  **Visual Break:** Every 300 words.
5.  **Engagement:** "Quick Poll" or "Question for Readers" (even if rhetorical).
6.  **Conclusion:** Summary + Clear Call to Action (CTA) + Link to related post.

## 5. ACCESSIBILITY & TECHNICAL SEO
*   **Alt Text:** All images must have descriptive alt text.
*   **Links:** 2-3 Internal Links to other TravelKing posts. 1-2 High-Authority External Links.
*   **Tone:** Conversational, authoritative, but friendly. "We" and "You" language.
