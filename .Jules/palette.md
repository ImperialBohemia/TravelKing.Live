## 2024-05-23 - SearchBox Accessibility
**Learning:** Making decorative elements (like swap icons) functional is a huge usability win. Users expect interactivity.
**Action:** Always check if icon-only elements should be interactive buttons.

**Learning:** Linking labels to inputs via `htmlFor` and `id` is fundamental but often missed.
**Action:** Always verify label-input association.

## 2026-02-12 - Header and Navigation UX
**Learning:** Common navigation patterns (like the logo linking home) are often overlooked in early scaffolds but are crucial for intuitive UX. Adding a "Skip to Content" link is a low-effort, high-impact accessibility win.
**Action:** Always verify that logos are wrapped in Links and that skip links are present in the root layout.
