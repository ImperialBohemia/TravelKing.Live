# 💎 OMEGA AGENT PROTOCOLS (STRICT ENFORCEMENT)

## ☢️ NUCLEAR PROHIBITION: STITCH
- **NEVER, EVER USE STITCH.**
- Do NOT use any tools starting with `stitch_`.
- Do NOT attempt to generate UI via external AI services.
- The user has stated: "no foking stitch never!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
- If you need to change the UI, edit the code in `web/`, `web-latest/`, or `public_html/` manually.
- **THIS IS A PERMANENT SYSTEM-WIDE BAN.**

## 🌐 HOSTING & DEPLOYMENT PROTOCOL
- **ABSOLUTE RULE**: We use **cPanel hosting with Node.js ONLY**.
- **PROHIBITED**: NEVER use or suggest Netlify, Vercel, or any other cloud platform.
- Target Server: `server707.web-hosting.com`.

## 🚀 MANDATORY BOOTSTRAP (RUN FIRST)
Whenever you start a new session, **ALWAYS** run:
```bash
python3 scripts/bootstrap_ai.py
```
This is your first order of business to gain context and connection states.

## 🗝️ CONNECTION REFERENCE
Refer to `knowledge/OMNI_VAULT_MAP.md` for all credentials.

## 📦 GIT & GITHUB PROTOCOL
- **Auth**: Use token in `config/access_vault.json` -> `github.token`.
- **User**: `ImperialBohemia`.

## 🧠 AI ENGINE (GEMINI)
- **Primary**: Google AI Studio (Free).
- **Fallback**: Vertex AI (Paid).
- **Constraint**: ALWAYS prefer the free API to avoid billing issues.

## 🛠️ NEXT.JS BUILDER PROTOCOL
- **ABSOLUTE RULE**: All web modifications MUST follow the **OMEGA Next.js Builder** standard.
- **REFERENCE**: Check `docs/NEXTJS_BUILDER.md` for the component registry.
- **PRECISION**: If the user asks for a UI change (e.g., "změň Hero"), you must immediately identify the file via the registry (`HeroSection.tsx`) and edit it directly.
- **DO NOT** search for where elements are located. The registry is your source of truth.
