## Critical Instruction: Stitch Tool Usage
- **NEVER** use any tools prefixed with `stitch_` (e.g., `stitch_create_project`, `stitch_generate_screen_from_text`, etc.).
- The user has explicitly requested to **never use Stitch again**.
- All UI and frontend work must be done manually or using standard web technologies (HTML/CSS/JS/Next.js) within the codebase, NOT via the Stitch service.
