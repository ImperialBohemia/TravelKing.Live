# Don't Let Them Keep Your Money

If you've flown from an EU/UK airport, or on an EU/UK airline to one, you are protected by EC 261/2004 or UK 261. These regulations are the gold standard of passenger rights.

## When Are You Eligible?

*   **Delay:** Arrival at final destination is delayed by 3+ hours.
*   **Cancellation:** Flight cancelled less than 14 days before departure.
*   **Denied Boarding:** Overbooking.

## How Much Can You Get?

The compensation is fixed based on flight distance:

| Distance | Compensation |
| :--- | :--- |
| < 1,500 km | €250 |
| 1,500 - 3,500 km | €400 |
| > 3,500 km | €600 |

## The "Extraordinary Circumstances" Loophole

Airlines will almost *always* claim "extraordinary circumstances" (weather, ATC strikes) to avoid paying.

**Tactical Advice:**
*   Check the weather reports yourself.
*   If other flights are landing, it's not the weather.
*   "Technical issues" are **NOT** extraordinary circumstances. They are the airline's responsibility.

## Automated Recovery

Don't waste time fighting legal teams yourself. Use automated services like **AirHelp** to handle the bureaucracy. They take a cut, but they win cases you would lose.
