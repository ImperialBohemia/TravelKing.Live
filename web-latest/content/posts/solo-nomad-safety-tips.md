# Operational Security for the Nomad

The "Digital Nomad" lifestyle is often sold as sunsets and laptops on beaches. The reality is that you are a high-value target in low-trust environments. You carry thousands of dollars in electronics and lack local support networks.

## 1. The decoy Wallet Protocol

Never carry all your assets in one place.
*   **Primary Wallet:** Hidden on your body (money belt or inside pocket). Contains primary credit cards and large cash.
*   **Decoy Wallet:** Carried in back pocket. Contains expired credit cards, a small amount of "sacrificial" cash, and dummy ID.
*   **The Play:** If mugged, hand over the decoy immediately and run.

## 2. Digital Hardening

Your laptop is your livelihood. Losing it is catastrophic.
*   **Full Disk Encryption:** BitLocker (Windows) or FileVault (Mac) must be active. If stolen, your data is useless to thieves.
*   **Cloud Backup:** Continuous sync (Backblaze or Google Drive). Assume your hardware will be destroyed today.
*   **VPN:** Public Wi-Fi is a hostile network. Never connect without a VPN.

## 3. Accommodation Vetting

"Superhost" status on Airbnb is meaningless for security.
*   **The Deadbolt Check:** Does the door have a manual deadbolt that cannot be opened with a key from the outside?
*   **Floor Selection:** Avoid the ground floor (break-ins) and the top floor (fire entrapment). The 3rd-6th floors are the sweet spot.

## 4. The "Check-In" Routine

Establish a "Proof of Life" protocol with a trusted contact back home.
*   **Protocol:** Send a message every 24 hours.
*   **Escalation:** If you miss a check-in by 12 hours, they call you. If 24 hours, they call the embassy.

## 5. Situational Awareness (The OODA Loop)

Observe. Orient. Decide. Act.
*   **Phone Down:** Never walk while staring at your phone. You are blind.
*   **Back to Wall:** In cafes, sit with your back to the wall, facing the entrance.
*   **Trust Your Gut:** The subconscious processes danger signals faster than the conscious mind. If a street "feels" wrong, it is. Turn around.

## Conclusion

Paranoia is a survival trait. Safety allows for freedom. By mitigating the downside risks, you free your mind to enjoy the exploration.
