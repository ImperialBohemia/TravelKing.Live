# The Solo Traveler's Handbook

Traveling solo is the ultimate freedom, but it comes with unique risks. In 2026, safety isn't just about physical security; it's about digital hygiene and situational awareness.

## 1. The "Dummy Wallet" Protocol

Never carry all your cash and cards in one place. Keep a "dummy wallet" with expired cards and a small amount of cash in your pocket. If mugged, hand over the dummy wallet without hesitation.

**Pro Tip:** Keep your real cards and passport in a hidden money belt or a secure hotel safe.

## 2. Digital Air-Gapping

Public Wi-Fi is a minefield. Use a portable 5G hotspot or an eSIM from a reputable provider like **Airalo**. If you must use public Wi-Fi, a VPN is non-negotiable.

## 3. Share Your Location (Selectively)

Use trusted contacts in Google Maps or Apple Find My to share your real-time location with 2-3 people you trust back home. Set up a "check-in" protocol—if you don't message by a certain time, they escalate.

## 4. Trust Your Gut (The Lizard Brain)

Evolution gave you instincts for a reason. If a situation feels "off," leave immediately. Don't worry about being polite.

## 5. Travel Insurance is Essential

It's the boring purchase you hope you never use. Medical evacuations can cost $50,000+. Ensure your policy covers "adventure activities" if you plan on motorbiking or hiking.
