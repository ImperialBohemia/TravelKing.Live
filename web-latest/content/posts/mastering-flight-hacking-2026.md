# The New Era of Travel

Travel in 2026 is data-driven. The old ways of booking—checking a single aggregator on a Tuesday afternoon—are dead. To travel like a king on a pauper's budget, you need to leverage the same tools the airlines use.

## 1. The VPN Pivot

Airlines price dynamically based on *your* location. A flight from London to Bangkok might cost £800 if booked from the UK, but only £550 if "booked" from Bangkok.

**Actionable Intel:**
*   Use a VPN to tunnel to the destination country.
*   Browse in Incognito/Private mode to avoid cookie tracking.
*   Check prices in the local currency.

## 2. Hidden City Ticketing

Why pay for a direct flight when a layover is cheaper? Sometimes a flight from A to C with a layover in B is cheaper than a direct flight to B. You simply get off at B.

> [!WARNING]
> Do NOT check bags. They will go to the final destination (C). This strategy works for carry-on only.

## 3. Error Fares: The Holy Grail

Airlines make mistakes. Currency conversion errors, fuel surcharge omissions, or fat-finger data entry can result in business class seats selling for economy prices.

**Where to find them:**
*   **Secret Flying**
*   **Jack's Flight Club**
*   **TravelKing Intelligence Alerts** (Coming Soon)

## Conclusion

Information is currency. By using these strategies, you stop being a passenger and start being a player in the global travel market. Stay tuned for more intel.
