# The Algorithm Wars

Finding a cheap flight is no longer about checking multiple websites. It is a war against dynamic pricing algorithms designed to extract the maximum amount of money you are willing to pay.

In 2026, the airlines use AI to track your device, your location, and your urgency. To win, you must become invisible.

## The Foundations of Stealth

### 1. Digital Hygiene
Never search for flights on your primary browser profile.
*   **Use a clean browser:** Firefox Focus or a dedicated Chrome profile.
*   **Clear Cookies:** Algorithms track "search intent." If they see you checking the same route three times, the price goes up.
*   **Mobile vs. Desktop:** Airlines often show different prices to mobile users. Check both.

### 2. Geo-Arbitrage (VPN Warfare)
Flight prices are determined by the Point of Sale (POS). A ticket purchased in London for a flight from London to Bangkok might cost £800. The *exact same ticket* purchased from a Thai IP address might cost £600.
*   **Strategy:** Use a VPN to tunnel into a lower-income country (e.g., India, Turkey, Argentina) before searching.
*   **Currency:** Always pay in the local currency of the airline to avoid bad exchange rates.

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Skiplagging (Hidden City Ticketing)
This remains the most powerful weapon in the arsenal, despite airline crackdowns.
*   **The Concept:** A flight from A -> B -> C is often cheaper than a flight from A -> B. You buy the ticket to C, but get off at B.
*   **The Risk:** You cannot check bags. If the airline catches you, they may void your return ticket or ban your frequent flyer account.
*   **Execution:** Only do this on one-way tickets. Do not associate your frequent flyer number.

### 2. Fuel Dumping (The Dark Arts)
This is complex and rare, but powerful. It involves adding a "3rd strike" flight to an itinerary to confuse the pricing engine into dropping the fuel surcharge (YQ).
*   **Example:** Flying Europe to USA. You add a small, cheap flight within Asia to the end of the booking. The system glitches and removes the 00 fuel surcharge from the main trans-Atlantic leg.

## The Toolset

Do not use Expedia. Use professional tools.
1.  **Google Flights (The Map):** Best for broad "explore" searches.
2.  **ITA Matrix:** The raw data engine behind Google. Allows complex routing codes.
3.  **Skyscanner:** Best for including budget airlines that major aggregators miss.

## Conclusion

Flight hacking is a cat-and-mouse game. As soon as a loophole becomes popular, it is closed. Stay liquid. Stay informed.
