# cPanel Deployment Plan - TravelKing.Live

## STRATEGY: Zero Files on cPanel
- Domain: travelking.live points to Google Sites (CNAME)
- No PHP/HTML files needed on server
- Only DNS configuration matters

## DNS Records (Already Set):
- www.travelking.live -> CNAME -> ghs.googlehosted.com
- travelking.live -> A records -> Google IPs

## What to DELETE from cPanel:
- All public_html files (not needed)
- Old PHP scripts
- Test files

## What to KEEP:
- Email accounts (if any)
- DNS settings
- SSL certificate (auto via cPanel)

## RESULT:
Clean cPanel with ZERO files, just DNS pointing to Google.
